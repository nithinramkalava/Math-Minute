# Math Minute

## Description

Math Minute is a mobile app that challenges users to solve as many math problems as they can in one minute. Users are presented with a series of randomly generated addition and subtraction problems, and must choose the correct answer from four options. The app keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the game.

## Installation

The app can be installed on any Android device running Android 7.0 Nougat or higher. To install, simply download the APK file from the [latest release](https://github.com/nithinramkalava/Math-Minute/releases/latest) and install it on your device.

## Usage

To play the game, simply open the app and tap the "Start" button. The game will begin immediately and will last for one minute. Solve as many problems as you can before the time runs out!

At the end of the game, your score will be displayed on the screen along with a list of the problems you answered and how long it took you to answer each one.
